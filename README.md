# TVMaze Searcher

My implementation of a simple search that searches for TV shows from https://www.tvmaze.com/api and displaying a summary about the show when choosen

If given more time I would have expanded the summary page with more information about the crew, cast, seasons et.c

Also switch to used something like Reqct Query for handling loading and error states better.

To be able to run the application clone the repo from https://github.com/thagge/TVMazeSearch

```
git clone https://github.com/thagge/TVMazeSearch
```

After the repository is cloned run the command

```
npm install
```

If you need to install npm go to https://nodejs.org/en

After the installation is done run the command

```
npm run dev
```

And go the application url in the console
